## Economic Principles

### Core Economic Strategies
While detailed numbers are being finalized, Baron DeFi will implement these fundamental economic principles:

#### Treasury Backing
- Every $BARON token backed by diversified protocol assets
- Guaranteed minimum value floor that increases over time
- Conservative treasury management for long-term stability

#### Sustainable Emissions
- Multi-phase emission schedule balancing growth and sustainability
- High initial APY for protocol bootstrapping
- Gradual transition to sustainable long-term yields

#### Revenue Generation
- Trade route tariff collection (protocol fee)
- Import License premiums over backing price
- Trade War entry fees and competition mechanics
- Alliance partnership revenue sharing

## Revenue Model

### Revenue Framework
The protocol will generate sustainable revenue through multiple streams:

#### Primary Revenue Streams

2. **⚔️ Trade War Fees**: Competition entry and participation costs

#### Secondary Revenue Streams  
3. **💼 Import License Premiums**: Profit margins over backing price
