## General Questions

### Protocol Basics

**Q: How does Baron DeFi differ from other protocols?**
A: Baron DeFi adds strategic gameplay through trade route control, creating utility beyond traditional bond/stake mechanics. Our triple-strategy system provides sustainable economics where strategic skill enhances capital efficiency.

**Q: Is this sustainable beyond high initial APY?**
A: Yes. While we offer competitive initial APY for bootstrapping, our trade route mechanics create genuine utility that sustains value beyond token inflation. Treasury backing ensures minimum token value that increases over time.

**Q: Can I participate passively?**
A: Absolutely. Simple staking provides competitive returns without active participation. However, users who engage with trade routes and Trade Wars can potentially earn significantly higher returns through strategic gameplay.

**Q: What makes Baron DeFi different from other OHM forks?**
A: Beyond standard OHM mechanics, we add:
- Strategic trade route control for ongoing revenue
- Competitive Trade Wars with real rewards
- Cross-protocol alliance opportunities
- Dynamic tariff optimization challenges
- Multi-layered gameplay that rewards skill and strategy

## Mechanics Questions

### Core Functionality

**Q: How are tariff rates determined?**
A: Tariff rates are set by route controllers through weighted voting based on control percentages. Finding optimal rates is a strategic challenge that separates successful participants from others.

**Q: What happens if I lose route control?**
A: If rival participants deploy larger positions, your control percentage decreases. You'll still earn tariffs proportional to your remaining control, but with reduced influence over rate-setting decisions.

**Q: Can I participate without alliance tokens?**
A: Yes. Alliance Routes are optional enhancements. Standard routes offer excellent opportunities for all participants regardless of external token holdings.

**Q: How do Trade Wars work exactly?**
A: Trade Wars are weekly competitive events with three phases:
1. **Preparation** (24h): Plan strategies and form alliances
2. **Combat** (48-72h): Execute attacks and defend territories  
3. **Resolution** (24h): Calculate results and distribute rewards

### Technical Questions

**Q: What blockchain is Baron DeFi built on?**
A: Baron DeFi is built on Hyperliquid EVM, providing fast transactions and low fees optimized for DeFi applications.

**Q: How do I track my performance?**
A: The Baron DeFi dashboard provides comprehensive analytics including:
- Real-time position values and yields
